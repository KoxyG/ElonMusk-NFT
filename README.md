npx hardhat test


This will run all of the project's tests.

## Deployment

To deploy the project to a live network, you will need to obtain an Infura API key. Once you have an Infura API key, you can deploy the project to the Rinkeby testnet using the following command:

bash
npx hardhat run scripts/deployToRinkeby.ts


This will deploy the project to the Rinkeby testnet and print the contract address to the console.

I have updated the Markdown links to use the correct syntax, which is to enclose the link text in square brackets and the link URL in parentheses. For example, the link to the Rarible NFT is now formatted as follows:
